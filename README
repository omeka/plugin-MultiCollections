Multi Collections (plugin for Omeka)
====================================

About
-----

[Multicollections] supercedes [Omeka]'s regular collection handling to allow items
to be in more than one collection.


Requirements
------------

The RecordRelations plugin must be installed and activated.


Usage
-----

Because MultiCollections tries to supercede Omeka's regular collection system,
themes will not display the collection information from MultiCollections.
However, helper functions that correspond to the relevant theming functions are
provided. The following corresponds to existing Omeka 1.5 functions of similar
name when you remove the multicollections_ prefix:
* multicollections_get_collections_for_item
* multicollections_get_items_in_collection
* multicollections_loop_items_in_collection
* multicollections_total_items_in_collection
* multicollections_item_belongs_to_collection
* multicollections_link_to_items_in_collection

Currently, these names are kept in the release for Omeka 2.0.

To loop through the collections for an item and display a link, for example on
the item show page, something like this will work, using the `multicollections_loop_collections_for_item()`
function:

```php
    <?php if (multicollections_item_belongs_to_collection()): ?>
    <div id="collection" class="element">
        <h3><?php echo __('Collections'); ?></h3>
        <?php while(multicollections_loop_collections_for_item()): ?>
        <div class="element-text"><p><?php echo link_to_collection(); ?></p></div>
        <?php endwhile; ?>
    </div>
    <?php endif; ?>
```


Warning
-------

Use it at your own risk.

It's always recommended to backup your files and database regularly so you can
roll back if needed.
